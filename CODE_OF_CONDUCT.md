# Code of Conduct for Contributors

## Pledge

In the inclination to create an open and pleasing environment for project maintenance, we as contributors and maintainers of the project pledge to making participation in our project and our community a welcoming experience for everyone irrespective of age, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal experience, race, religion or sexual identity and orientation. Participation is open and free because we think it is supposed to be.

## Standards

We welcome the following examples of behaviour as it contributes in creating a positive environment.

- Use of pleasing and inclusive language
- To be respectful for deviating viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on the betterment of the project and the community
- Showing empathy towards other fellow contributors

We do not welcome the following examples of behaviour by the participants.

- Use of sexualized languages or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Troll, insult or use of passing derogatory comment as well as making personal/political comments
- Doing public or private harassment
- Publishing others' sensitive information without their consent
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for making the standards of acceptable behaviour clear to the participants and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any violation of the standards laid down by this code of conduct document.

Project maintainers reserve the right and responsibility to remove, edit or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not fall in line with the Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive or harmful.

## Scope

The standards laid down by the code of conduct document applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Example of such project or community representation include using an official project mailing address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may further be clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [socials@astrosonic.tech](mailto:socials@astrosonic.tech). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated thoroughly and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
